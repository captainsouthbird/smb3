# smb3
Disassembly of Super Mario Bros 3

Specifically for use with NESASM (https://github.com/camsaul/nesasm), this will reassemble into a byte-for-byte perfect clone of Super Mario Bros. 3 US (PRG1)

To assemble, simply run:

nesasm smb3.asm

Intended for use for research into the inner workings of SMB3 and highly technical ROM hacks (such as Super Mario Bros. 3Mix)
